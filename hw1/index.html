        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <ol>
            In this assignment, we implemented a Rasterizer with basic functionality using software.<br>
			Specifically, we started by rendering triangles and then applied the supersampling technique for anti-aliasing.<br>
			We also implemented several basic transformations and applied them to hierarchical represented skeletons, reviewing the theoretical aspects of transformations.<br>
			Next, we implemented barycentric coordinate calculations, laying the groundwork for rendering colors and implementing texture mapping.<br>
			Finally, we implemented a texture mapping renderer that supports different pixel sampling methods (PSM) and level sampling methods (LSM).<br>
			In summary, rasterizing is a method of mapping abstract graphics (geometry, colors, textures, and perhaps lighting, shadows, etc.) onto a raster display.<br>
			In practical terms, this usually involves calculating the mapping relationship between pixels and colors and transmitting it to a frame buffer for display.<br>

        <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>

        <!-- Task 1 Questions -->
        <ol>
            <li>Rasterize Triangles<br>
			We first find the bounding box that just enclose the triangle. 
			Then we go through each pixel in the rectangle using funtion "insideTriangle" to detemine whether it is in the Triangle.
			Function "insideTriangle" uses the cross product of vectors formed by the vertices and the test point to determine if the point lies inside the triangle. </li><br>
            <li>Compare with the method that checks each sample within the bounding box of the tirangle<br>
			It's just the same.</li><br>

        <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>

        <!-- Task 2 Questions -->
        <ol>
            <li>Why supersampling useful?<br>
			By using it, we can have smootehr lines and fewer jaggies, thus enhance antialiasing and improve image quality. 
			Besides, it can reduce rendering artifacts and handle subpixel details.</li><br>
            <li>Modifications & Use supersampling to antialiasing triangles<br>
			Firstly, the size of framebuff should be expanded to smaple_rate times the original size.
			Then rasterizing is similiar but using the bigger sample_buffer.
			At last, we need to average each subpixels to get the color</li><br>

			Using supersampling, we can get smoother lines and fewer jaggies because at the edges of triangles, colors are sampled by subpixels and then averaged.

        <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping </h2>

        <!-- Task 5 Questions -->
        <ol>
            <li>Pixel sampling is how to determine the color mapping relationship between the screen pixel and the texels in its footprint in the texture(uv) space.<br>
				We implement them as two functions which takes uv coordinates as parameters and return the color determined by the method.<br>
				Nearest: Choose the color of whichever texel's closest to the screen pixel's footprint.<br>
				Bilinear: Linear interpolating the four neighbor texel's colors as the pixel's color.</li>
            <li>Let's show the rendering result of svg/texmap/test1.svg<br>
				Upleft: PSM = nearest, Sampling_rate = 1; Upright: PSM = bilinear, Sampling_rate = 1;<br>
				Bottomleft: PSM = nearest, Sampling_rate = 16; Bottomright: PSM = bilinear, Sampling_rate = 16;<br>
				<div style="display: flex;">

				</div>
			</li>
            <li>As we can see clearly from the white longitudes, the result of bilinear defeats nearest.<br>
				The difference is clearer when the gradient of color is huge and when the sampling rate is low<br>
				(if the sampling rate is high, then how to select the color out of the one-sixteenth texel doesn't really matter.)</li>
        </ol>

    <section>
        <h2>Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping </h2>

        <!-- Task 6 Questions -->
        <ol>
            <li>Level sampling is how to determine the color out of the texels on different mipmap levels.<br>
				We implement it in function "Texture::sample", calling the get_level function to get the float D number and determine what color to return, the nearest level or lerping between two neighbor levels.<br></li>
            <li>In terms of speed, PSM doesn't really make a difference(it's only about selecting in O(1)), but using linear will make it a bit slower;<br>
					Choosing to use mipmap technique will slow it down because we need to calculate the d values and calculate on different mipmap levels;<br>
					Supersampling rate will make a huge difference because we need to process n^2 more times for each pixel.<br>
					In terms of memory usage, apparently PSM doesn't make a difference;<br>
					Choosing to use mipmap technique will increase the memory usage by about 1.33 (need to store each level of mipmaps, one forth, one sixteenth...);<br>
					Supersampling rate won't make a huge difference on memory usage.<br>
					In terms of anti-aliasing power, PSM: bilinear is better than nearest;<br>
					LSM: Linear is better than nearest;<br>
					The larger the supersampling rate, the better the result would be.<br>
				</li>
            <li>Let's show the rendering result of svg/texmap/test1.svg<br>
				Upleft: PSM = nearest, LSM = zero; Upright: PSM = bilinear, LSM = Zero;<br>
				Bottomleft: PSM = nearest, LSM = nearest; Bottomright: PSM = bilinear, LSM = nearest;<br>
